trafic-grid-light-control
===================

A project made in netlogo to simulate traffic movement.

This simulation basically aims to predict the best lights control algrithm for a certain road network with varous traffic flow patterns. 

+ HOW IT WORKS

++ draw-roads++
+++ node_list
+++ link_list
+++ junction_light_list 
+++ junction_phase_list
+++ entrance_list

+ HOW TO USE IT

First pressing the "setup" button to intialise all the variables. Then pressing "go" button to start the simulation process.
